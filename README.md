# Hospitality_Data_Analysis_Project

## Atliq Grands Revenue Analysis Dashboard ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project was created to help Atliq Grands, a five-star hotel chain, analyze a significant decline in its **market share and revenue** observed over a three-month period. To investigate the issue and uncover actionable insights, I designed and developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** based on historical business data.

## Objective
To enable data-driven decision-making by:
- Analyzing three months of revenue data to identify patterns and causes of decline
- Visualizing key business metrics to highlight performance gaps
- Empowering the Revenue team with insights to support strategic recovery plans

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** â€“ for building interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **Microsoft Excel/CSV** â€“ for storing and cleaning three months of historical data
- **Power Query** â€“ for data transformation and modeling

## Key Features
- **Trend Visualization:** Revenue and market share trends over time
- **Interactive Filters:** Drill-down capability by category, region, and month
- **Dynamic KPI Cards:** Quick snapshot of key metrics (e.g., revenue, profit)
- **Comparative Analysis:** Helps compare historical performance against targets

## Outcome
- Enabled the Revenue team to clearly understand performance drops through data
- Provided clarity for formulating actionable recovery strategies
- Supported the business goal to **regain 20% of lost revenue and market share** within the next month
